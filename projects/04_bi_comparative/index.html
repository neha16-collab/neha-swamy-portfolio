<h1>Comparative BI — Power BI vs Tableau</h1>
<p>Used the same dataset to build equivalent dashboards in both Power BI and Tableau, then compared build effort, interactivity, performance, and strengths of each tool. The goal was to understand where each BI platform fits best in a modern analytics stack.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Power BI:</b> Focused on a governed semantic model, reusable measures, calculation groups, and drill-through navigation.</li>
  <li><b>Tableau:</b> Focused on rapid exploration, interactive storytelling, custom visuals, and flexible layout design.</li>
  <li><b>Comparison:</b> Evaluated feature set, development speed, refresh performance, and user experience for business stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Finance Sales & Profitability (SQL • Python • Power BI)</h1>

<p>
Star schema (Sales, Products, Customers, Calendar). KPIs: Revenue, Gross Margin %, Average Selling Price (ASP),
Year-over-Year growth, and Last-3-Months performance. Python EDA for outliers & seasonality. Power BI with
drill-through from Country → Region → Customer → Product.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>SQL:</b> Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for time-intelligence and gross margin calculations.</li>
  <li><b>Python:</b> Pandas-based EDA, monthly trend checks, and sanity checks on revenue & cost distributions.</li>
  <li><b>BI:</b> Power BI report with bookmarks, tooltip pages, and a robust Date table powered by DAX.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Problem</h2>
<p>
The regional finance team needed a unified, trusted view of revenue, gross margin %, and product mix to replace
multiple Excel files and manual slide decks. The goal was to quickly answer: “Which regions and products drive
profitability over time, and where are we losing margin?”
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sales fact table: ~250k rows over 3 years, one row per invoice line.</li>
  <li>Dimensions: Products, Customers, Calendar (role-playing dates for Order Date and Ship Date).</li>
  <li>Source: CSV exports simulating ERP extracts, cleaned and validated with Python & SQL before loading into BI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Modeled a star schema with a reusable Date dimension and conformed dimensions for Products and Customers.</li>
  <li>Wrote SQL to compute base metrics (net sales, discounts, cost of goods) and staged them into reporting tables.</li>
  <li>Used Python (Pandas) to validate aggregate totals, check monthly seasonality, and detect outlier transactions before reporting.</li>
  <li>Built a Power BI report with drill-through from Region → Customer → Product, and DAX time-intelligence for MTD/QTD/YTD and YoY comparisons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identified that ~15% of SKUs contributed close to 70% of revenue (classic Pareto pattern), guiding focus for promotions and stock planning.</li>
  <li>Found two regions with strong revenue but weak gross margins due to heavy discounting and freight costs.</li>
  <li>Created a reusable Date table and core KPI measures that can be plugged into future finance and sales reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SQL scripts:</b> Staging logic and KPI calculation queries for revenue, margin, and ASP.</li>
  <li><b>Python notebook:</b> EDA notebook for validation, seasonal trend checks, and outlier detection.</li>
  <li><b>Power BI report (PBIX) or screenshots:</b> Final interactive dashboard with drill-through and tooltips.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If This Were in Production</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Schedule automated refreshes (daily/weekly) via an ETL/ELT pipeline with data quality checks.</li>
  <li>Add row-level security (RLS) so regional managers only see their markets.</li>
  <li>Instrument usage metrics to see which pages and filters are most used by stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

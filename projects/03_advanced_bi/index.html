<h1>Advanced BI — Semantic Model & Row-Level Security</h1>
<p>Built a reusable semantic model: calculation groups for time intelligence, role-playing dates (Order/Ship), and RLS by Region & Manager. Documented lineage and measures catalogue.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Model:</b> Composite model; shared date</li>
  <li><b>DAX:</b> Calc group for MTD/QTD/YTD</li>
  <li><b>Security:</b> RLS by Region role</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Problem</h2>
<p>
Multiple teams needed consistent KPIs across reports (sales, finance, operations), but each workbook was
defining calculations slightly differently. There was also a need to restrict data access based on region
and management hierarchy without creating separate reports for each audience.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fact tables for orders and shipments, each with its own date fields and related dimensions.</li>
  <li>Shared dimensions for Customers, Products, and a central Date table.</li>
  <li>User attributes such as Region and Manager used to drive row-level security rules.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed a reusable semantic model with a single Date dimension acting as a role-playing date for both Order and Ship dates.</li>
  <li>Implemented a calculation group to standardize time-intelligence patterns (MTD, QTD, YTD, rolling periods, YoY comparisons).</li>
  <li>Defined Row-Level Security (RLS) roles that filter data by Region and Manager, ensuring users see only their relevant slice of data.</li>
  <li>Documented a measures catalogue and table-level descriptions so future reports can plug into the same model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Semantic consistency eliminated differences in how core KPIs (revenue, margin, volume) were calculated across reports.</li>
  <li>RLS allowed a single report to serve many audiences – executives, regional managers, and analysts – without duplicating logic.</li>
  <li>Calculation groups reduced the number of DAX measures and made it easier to add new time-based views.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>PBIX model file:</b> Semantic model with tables, relationships, and calculation group.</li>
  <li><b>RLS roles:</b> Defined security roles by Region and Manager for controlled access.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation:</b> Measures catalogue, model diagram, and RLS design notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If This Were in Production</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Host the model in a centralized workspace as a shared dataset for multiple reports.</li>
  <li>Integrate with Azure AD security groups for automated user-to-role assignment.</li>
  <li>Version and test changes to measures and roles before promoting to production.</li>
</ul>

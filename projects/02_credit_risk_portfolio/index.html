<h2>Business Problem</h2>
<p>
A lending team wanted to understand which segments of their loan portfolio carry the highest risk of default,
and how risk varies across FICO bands, DTI, LTV, utilization, and product type. The objective was to identify
high-risk pockets and support more informed credit policy decisions.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loan-level dataset with features such as FICO score, DTI, LTV, utilization, product type, term, and status.</li>
  <li>Target variable indicating default / non-default or charge-off state.</li>
  <li>Historical observation window representing origination and subsequent performance over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Performed EDA to understand distributions, missingness, and correlations between risk drivers and default.</li>
  <li>Used Weight of Evidence (WoE) / Information Value (IV) to evaluate the predictive strength of key variables.</li>
  <li>Built a baseline logistic regression model to estimate default probability at the loan level.</li>
  <li>Segmented the portfolio into risk bands and visualized the results using Tableau cohort and heatmap views.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Higher default rates were concentrated in low FICO bands with high utilization and higher DTI buckets.</li>
  <li>Some product types showed elevated risk despite apparently reasonable FICO, suggesting pricing or policy review.</li>
  <li>Clear risk tiers emerged that could be translated into policy rules, such as stricter limits or enhanced monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>EDA notebook:</b> Exploratory analysis of portfolio behavior and risk factors.</li>
  <li><b>Model artifacts:</b> Baseline logistic regression, coefficients, and evaluation metrics (ROC/AUC, calibration).</li>
  <li><b>Tableau dashboard:</b> Visual views of risk distribution, cohorts, and segment-level performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If This Were in Production</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate model scores into the loan decisioning process for pre-approval or pricing suggestions.</li>
  <li>Monitor model performance over time for drift and recalibration needs.</li>
  <li>Expose key risk KPIs via dashboards to credit, risk, and collections teams.</li>
</ul>
